# Super Smash Bros. Brawl SiIvagunner Mega Music Mod

This mod adds all the high quality Super Smash Bros. Brawl rips of the SiIvagunner and Timmy Turner's Grand Dad Channel to Super Smash Bros. Brawl. Every rip replaces its corresponding original track and where there are multiple rips, they are all put in a loop.

2. In the Dolphin game selection, right-click on your Brawl ISO, choose properties and click on the "Filesystem" tab (as it's the last/rightmost tab of the "properties" window, you might have to enlarge the window or click on the right arrow to see it. See the pic below).

4. Drag the `DATA` folder from the downloaded zip into the folder you extracted the disc, so that it get's merged with the `DATA` folder inside. If you did everything right, you should be told, that files with the same names already exist: Choose "Replace" for all files.
